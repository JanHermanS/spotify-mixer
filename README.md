Spotify Mixer 🎧Spotify Mixer is a powerful, JSON-configured automation tool written in Python. It allows you to build complex, dynamic Spotify playlists by mixing sources, filtering by genre/bpm, injecting new tracks, and managing local blacklists.Unlike simple "shufflers", this tool functions like a radio station programmer: it builds the flow of the playlist, enforces artist separation, and keeps your library fresh.⚠️ Important DisclaimersExperimental Scraper: This tool includes a fallback mechanism that scrapes the Spotify Embed HTML when the official API fails (e.g., for certain "Spotify Owned" playlists that return 404 via API). This feature is experimental and meant for educational purposes.Spotify API 2026: As of Feb 2026, Spotify has restricted access to "Audio Features" (BPM, Energy) for many developers.This script attempts to use ReccoBeats as a primary source for audio data.It includes a fallback to the official API.If both fail (Error 403), the script will automatically skip audio filters and continue generating the playlist without crashing.🚀 InstallationClone the repository:git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/spotify-mixer.git](https://github.com/yourusername/spotify-mixer.git)
cd spotify-mixer
Install requirements:pip install -r requirements.txt
(Requires spotipy and requests)🔑 Setup: Getting your API KeysTo use this tool, you need to create a simple "App" in the Spotify Developer Dashboard.Go to the Spotify Developer Dashboard.Log in with your Spotify account.Click "Create App".Fill in a name (e.g., "My Playlist Mixer") and description.Crucial Step: In the Redirect URIs field, enter:http://localhost:8888/callback
(Don't forget to click "Add" and "Save" at the bottom).Once created, go to the Settings of your app.Copy the Client ID and Client Secret.ConfigurationCreate a new file (e.g., my_radio.json) based on config.example.json. Paste your keys at the top:{
  "credentials": {
    "client_id": "PASTE_YOUR_CLIENT_ID_HERE",
    "client_secret": "PASTE_YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET_HERE",
    "redirect_uri": "http://localhost:8888/callback"
  },
  "workflow": [ ... ]
}
🛠️ UsageRun the script with Python, pointing it to your configuration file:python spotify_mixer.py my_radio.json
First Run:On the first run, a browser window will open (or a link will appear in the console). Log in to Spotify to authorize the app. This creates a hidden .cache file in the script directory so you don't have to log in again.📚 Workflow Actions ReferenceThe logic is defined in the workflow array in your JSON file. The script executes these actions sequentially.Input & Sourcessource: Fetches tracks from a Spotify Playlist, Album, or Artist.id: The Spotify ID (e.g., 37i9dQZF1DXcBWIGoYBM5M). Use "me" for your "Liked Songs".hydrate: "auto" (default), true, or false. Set to false for speed if you don't need artist/genre data immediately.source_file: Loads tracks from a local file.filename: Path to .json (database) or .txt file.sync_local_db: (Powerful) Syncs a Spotify playlist to a local JSON database and optionally clears the playlist. Great for maintaining "Inbox" style blacklists.mode: "append" (add new) or "remove" (whitelist logic).store_type: "tracks" (block specific songs) or "artists" (block the artist globally).clear_source: true to wipe the Spotify playlist after syncing.Manipulation & Mixingmix: Combines multiple previous outputs into one pool.inputs: Array of output names (e.g., ["src_hits", "src_classics"]).sample: Randomly picks N tracks from the input.amount: Number of tracks to keep.slice: Takes the first N tracks (useful after sorting).amount: Number of tracks to keep.dedup: Removes duplicate tracks based on URI.inject: Inserts tracks from one list into another at regular intervals.input: The base list.inject_input: The list to inject.every: Interval (e.g., 10).variance: Randomness (e.g., 2 means interval is 8-12).Filteringfilter_genre: Keeps or removes tracks based on artist genres.genres: List of keywords (e.g., ["rock", "metal"]).mode: "include" or "exclude".filter_artist: Removes tracks if the artist appears in a blacklist.blacklist_input: The input containing blocked tracks or artists (usually loaded via source_file from a database).filter_exclude: Removes specific tracks (by ID) found in another list.exclude_input: The input containing tracks to remove.filter_audio: Filters by BPM or Energy.min_bpm / max_bpm: Tempo range.min_energy / max_energy: Energy (0.0 - 1.0).fallback: Set to "none" to return an empty list on API failure, or default to keeping all tracks.season: Checks the current date and only includes tracks if the month matches.cases: Array of objects with months (e.g., [12]) and sources.Ordering & Savingsort: Sorts by popularity or other attributes.weighted_shuffle: A smart shuffle that prioritizes popular tracks but keeps the order random.factor: Higher number = more randomness. Lower number = stricter popularity sort.artist_separation: Reorders the list to ensure the same artist doesn't play within N tracks.min_distance: e.g., 10.save: Pushes the result to a Spotify Playlist.id: Target Playlist ID.Note: This performs a "Wipe & Write" (clears the playlist first) to ensure exact syncing.📂 Example WorkflowsCheck the Examples/ folder for inspiration:config.example.json: Basic starter template.workflow_maintenance.json: How to manage local blacklists.workflow_advanced_radio.json: A full radio station logic with seasons and injections.📄 LicenseThis project is open-source.
